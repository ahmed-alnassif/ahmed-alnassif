## 🎪 Security Philosophy

### Operational Principles
```python
def conduct_security_operation(target):
    if target.complexity == "enterprise_network":
        return advanced_persistence_and_pivoting()
    elif target.type == "web_application":
        return business_logic_exploitation()
    elif target.platform == "mobile":
        return reverse_engineering_and_hooking()
    else:
        return custom_exploit_development()
```
